  "chapterSummary": "This chapter establishes the fundamental distinction between metals and non-metals based on physical properties (lustre, malleability, ductility, sonority, conductivity) and chemical properties (reactions with oxygen, water, acids, and bases). Metals form basic oxides, react with acids to produce hydrogen, and are good conductors. Non-metals form acidic oxides, generally don't react with water or acids, and are poor conductors. Displacement reactions demonstrate relative reactivity, with more reactive metals displacing less reactive ones. Both material types have crucial applications: metals in construction and machinery, non-metals in life processes and chemical industries.",
