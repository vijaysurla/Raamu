  "chapterSummary": "This chapter establishes that sound is produced by vibrating objects and requires a material medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel—it cannot travel through a vacuum. Sound characteristics include amplitude (determining loudness, measured in dB) and frequency (determining pitch, measured in Hz). The human audible range is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. While sound is essential for communication, excessive noise pollution causes serious health issues including hearing impairment, hypertension, and sleep problems, making noise control through silencers and tree planting crucial for environmental health.",
